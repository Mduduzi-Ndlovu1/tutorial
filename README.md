So the journey begins:

Lets begin by describing the purpose of each component as each teaches me more elements of React

Profile.js involves props and how to use them.
Message.js describes how to use React class components and showing the differences between functional components and class components 

Counter.js originated from the differences between props and states and shows the differences and how states actually work, well in terms of how to change states 

FunctionalCounter.js speaks to how functonal compnents can use States. Through the use of Hooks and in this particular example am using useState funciton from react, to have a funcitonal component have states which can be updated. I use the counter to demonstrate this use of hooks. Pretty cool and i really dont know (yet) why class components are used if all this beauty can be implemented into funcitonal components idk man am just happy i finally understand hooks
